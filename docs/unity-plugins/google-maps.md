The plugin allows you to embed **Native [GoogleMapsView](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/MapView)** into your Android-Unity game. Note, this is **NOT** a Web View and **NOT** a Texture, its native interactive Google Map View.

# **Limitations**

**Please read the limitations carefully before purchasing:**

!> The view is **ALWAYS** shown on top of everything in your unity game. The view is implemented as an Android native dialog/iOS native view on top of Unity Activity.

!> Minimum supported Android version is **API level 16 (Jelly Bean)**

!> Minimum supported iOS version is **9.0**. 

!> **The plugin does NOT work in Editor! Only on iOS and Android** It is a native Android/iOS view (not a web view) so performance is awesome but there is no way to get native Android/iOS view working in Unity Editor.

!> **You can't move the view as a part of scene hierarchy (e.g scroll in Unity view)**. However, you can change the view size and position.
