# Copy this plugin to your project!

!> **It is recommended to copy the plugin to your `Plugins` folder as described [here](ue-plugins/common-issues?id=how-to-correctly-copy-the-marketplace-plugin-to-my-project-folder) if some iOS features do not work**. This must be done because UE Marketplace can't process packages that use new XCode APIs.
